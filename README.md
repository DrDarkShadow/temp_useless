# GitHub Monitoring Agent

This tool is a lightweight agent designed to monitor file changes within a local Git repository. It specifically identifies which files have been staged (`git add`) for the next commit.

## Features

-   Detects newly added and modified files in the Git staging area.
-   Filters detected files by a specific extension (e.g., `.py`, `.md`).
-   Provides a simple command-line interface (CLI).
-   Can be easily integrated into a `pre-commit` workflow.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.8+
-   Git installed on your system.
-   The Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd github_monitoring_agent
    ```

2.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Use

### Command-Line

You can run the agent directly from your terminal.

-   **Check the current directory for staged `.py` files:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

-   **Specify a different repository path and file extension:**
    ```bash
    python main.py --repo-path /path/to/your/repo --ext .md
    ```

### With `pre-commit`

This agent is ideal for use with the `pre-commit` framework to automatically check for changes before you commit.

1.  Install `pre-commit`:
    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

2.  Make sure a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file exists in your project's root with content similar to the one in this repository.

3.  Install the git hook:
    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

Now, every time you run `git commit`, the `check-changes` script will be triggered automatically.
